# Pharloom's Glory

Pharloom's Glory modifies game assets in specific areas to make them look and feel as they were in the past based on game lore.

This mod does **not** add any new gameplay scenes, it only modifies existing ones, replacing textures and adding game assets by parsing text files with custom scene modifications. However, there aren't significant gameplay changes as room layouts stay the same, the changes are usually only visual.

	* Removed wind effects

	* Removed wind effects
	* Replaced all of the sand and bone textures with coral ones
	* Revamped backgrounds with extra sprites and fish particles
