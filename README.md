# pharlooms-glory

Pharloom's Glory is a Hollow Knight: Silksong plugin that modifies game assets in specific areas to make them look and feel as they were in the past based on game lore.

This mod does not add any new gameplay scenes, it only modifies existing ones, replacing textures and adding game assets by parsing text files with custom scene modifications. However, there aren't significant gameplay changes as room layouts stay the same, the changes are usually only visual.

The audio system in this plugin was adapted from Ashiepaws's [Patchwork](https://github.com/Ashiepaws/silksong-patchwork) mod, please check it out.
